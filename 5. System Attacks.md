## Password Attacks

### John the Ripper
`# john --list=formats` shows all encryption formats that John can handle

Merge the `passwd` and `shadow` files first using `unshadow`

`# unshadow passwd shadow > crackme`

#### Brute Force
`# john -incremental -users:<list of users> <crackme file>`
`-users` chooses some users from the entire list of users in the file.

#### Dictionary
`$ john -wordlist [wordlist_file] <crackme file>`

If no `wordlist_file` is mentioned, the default is used.

Mangling tries combinations of the word e.g. `cat`, `cAt` etc.
- If you want some mangling, use the `-rules` argument with John.

To find wordlists, you can use the OWASP Seclists project
`# apt-get install seclists`

### `ophcrack`
Uses rainbow tables

## Buffer Overflow Attacks
