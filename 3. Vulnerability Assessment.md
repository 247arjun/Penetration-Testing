# Vulnerability Assessment
No exploitation in this phase.

If only a vulnerability assessment is required, reporting follows this phase.

## Vulnerability Scanners
Scanners use a database of known vulnerabilities and security audits to detect vulnerabilities on a system.

### Manual Testing
For custom applications, a scanner may not be enough.

- Learning and understanding its features
- Understanding how it exchanges data over the network
- Understanding how it accesses resources like databases, servers, local and remote files etc.
- Reverse engineering its logic

## Nessus
[Download Nessus](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home)

Nessus has a:
- Client to configure the scans (web interface)
- Server to actually perform the scanning process and report results back to the client

### How Nessus works
1. Port Scanning - determines if the target hosts are alive, and which ports are open on them
2. Service Detection - for every open port found, the scanner sends special probes to determine which application is running on them.
3. Vulnerabilities Database Lookup - For each service detected (daemon), the scanner queries its database looking for known vulnerabilities. 
4. Probing - the scanner sends probes to verify if the vulnerability actually exists.
