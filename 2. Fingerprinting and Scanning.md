# Fingerprinting and Scanning

## Mapping a Network
```ping www.site.net```

### Ping Sweeping

#### fping
Linux tool to perform ping sweeping

```fping -a -g IPRANGE```

```-a``` shows only alive hosts

```-g``` for ping sweep

IP range can be defined by CIDR notation (10.54.12.0/24)

### nmap

#### nmap Ping Scan
Can use wildcards, as a range or CIDR

``` nmap -sn 172.16.12.*```

You can save your host list in a file, and use the ```-iL``` switch

```nmap -sn -iL hostslist.txt```

nmap also has **host discovery features**

### OS Fingerprinting
With the above, you only which host is alive and has *responded to pings*. Tiny differences in the **network stack implementation** of the various OS are analyzed.

Offline OS fingerprinting can be done with [p0f](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/).

#### OS fingerprinting with nmap

Use the ```-o``` switch with nmap to perform OS fingerprinting.

Use the ```--osscan-limit``` to limit OS detection to promising targets

## Port Scanning
Discovers the daemons and servicing running on discovered nodes.

- TCP Connect Scan - Every TCP connect scan probe gets recorded in the daemon logs.

- TCP SYN Scan - Sends just a SYN packet.

### Port scanning with nmap
```-sT``` performs a TCP connect scan

```-sS``` performs a SYN (stealth) scan - this is the default

```-sV``` performs a version detection (uses TCP connect) scan

### Specifying nmap scan targets
1. Using DNS names
```nmap <scan type> target1.domain.com target2.domain.com```

2. With IP addresses listed
```nmap <scan type> 192.168.1.45 200.200.14.56```

3. Using CIDR notation
```nmap <scan type> 192.168.1.0/24 200.200.1.0/16```

4. Using wildcards
```nmap <scan type> 192.168.*.*```

5. Specifying ranges
```nmap <scan type> 200.200.6-12.*```

6. Octets Lists
```nmap <scan type> 10.14.33.1,3,17```

### Specifying nmap ports to scan
By default, nmap scans the most common ports used.

You can specify custom ports by using the ```-p``` option.

```nmap -p 100-1000 <target>```

### Discovering a Network with port scanning
Sometimes, a server will not respond to pings, but has many TCP/UDP ports open.

Perform a scan for ports 22 (SSH), 445 (SMB), 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

### Spotting a Firewall
If the version of port 80 is not recognized, or even a service on a port is not recognized (tcpwrapped).

Use the ```-reason``` switch on nmap to see why a port was marked open or closed.

### Masscan
Tool that can help you discover a network via probing TCP ports.

## nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
Scripts packaged with the NSE in Kali at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`

To see what a script does, use the `--script-help` option: 
`root@kali:~# nmap --script-help nfs-ls`

If you use the -sC flag to tell Nmap to run a script scan in addition to port scanning, it will run all the scripts in the default category: 
`root@kali:~# nmap -sC 192.168.20.10-12`

To run a script against a target: 
`root@kali:/# nmap --script=nfs-ls 192.168.20.11`
